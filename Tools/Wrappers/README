= C! Tools/Wrappers =

This directory contains .cbi files describing wrappers for some usual
functions from standard C library.

Contents:

- libc_alloc.cbi : malloc familly functions
- libc_assert.cbi : assert function
- libc_minimal_IO.cbi : quick wrappers for open/close and read/write

Test Files:

The directory include some test files for each wrapper. They are intended to
test if the wrapping is correct, the generated binaries may fail at execution on
purpose (the assert-test binary for example contains a false assertion.)
